Results :

We noticed that the encoded result using ECB repeats the encode -> 1F9AEA251916D454B9D5AA7F92D93607 due to the fact that we are using the same sequence of characters in this case "aaaaaaaaaa" that will be divided to half of the size and encoded.

In CBC is completely the encoded result is completely random due to the use of the iv vector that will mix with the original message before encoding.
