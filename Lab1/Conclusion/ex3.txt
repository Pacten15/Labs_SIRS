The problem with timestamp is that messages can be send the same if they are sent in a short period of time (miliseconds) implying that the nonce will not change. 
The problem with no nonce is if we sent the same message the digest would be the same everytime.


The solution each time we create a nonce we find a new set of random bytes for it.
