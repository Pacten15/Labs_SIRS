For confidentiality protection, we can use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher. 
AES is a symmetric key cipher, meaning the same key is used for encryption and decryption. 
It's widely used and considered very secure. We can use a key size of 256 bits and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, 
which is a common choice for block ciphers.

We're not using a hybrid cipher in this case. A hybrid cipher typically refers to a system that uses both 
symmetric and asymmetric encryption, such as using RSA for key exchange and AES for data encryption. 
In this case, we're only using AES for data encryption.

Here's how you can modify the `SecureWriter.java` and `SecureReader.java` to encrypt the JSON object:

In `SecureWriter.java`, encrypt the JSON object before writing it to the file:

```java
// Convert the JSON object to a byte array
String jsonString = jsonObject.toString();
byte[] documentBytes = jsonString.getBytes();

// Generate a random AES key
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
keyGen.init(256);
SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();

// Encrypt the document
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(documentBytes);

// Write the encrypted document to a file
Files.write(Paths.get("encryptedDocument.json"), encryptedBytes);
```

In `SecureReader.java`, decrypt the JSON object after reading it from the file:

```java
// Read the encrypted document from the file
byte[] encryptedBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("encryptedDocument.json"));

// Decrypt the document
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
byte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(encryptedBytes);

// Convert the decrypted bytes to a JSON object
String jsonString = new String(decryptedBytes);
JsonObject jsonObject = new Gson().fromJson(jsonString, JsonObject.class);
```

In this code, `secretKey` is the AES key used for encryption and decryption. 
You need to securely share this key between the writer and the reader.
