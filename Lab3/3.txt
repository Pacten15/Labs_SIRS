 Why can you not see the credentials of SSH when using tcpdump or wireshark?

ssh encrypts the connection

	 rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256



Config that works between vms:


VM2

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface, sw-1 interface and sw-2 interface
auto lo eth0 eth1 eth2
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.10
        netmask 255.255.255.0

iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.1.254 
        netmask 255.255.255.0 


VM3

Question: From which machine are you expecting the <port> and <ack number> in the 2.2.3 command?

The port of the machine that initialized the nc server and the ack number resulted from the connection of the vm with the vm that initilized a nc connection
